	<h1> S.S. Pathfinders </h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3> 
	  <p> S.S. Pathfinders was created to provide future students and visitors of Fleming College’s Frost Campus with an accessible and intuitive web application to aid in independent navigation, 
	  while providing college staff with the ability to easily customize the application for special events.  </p>
	  <p>As students who have previously completed diploma programs at Fleming College’s Frost Campus, the team at S.S. Pathfinders has a deep connection to the Frost Campus community.
	  We aim to use this connection alongside our passion for GIS to create an application that meets the needs of our <a href="project.html">problem statement</a> </p>
