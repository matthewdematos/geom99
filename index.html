	<h1> S.S. Pathfinders </h1>
	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	  <p>Education is an integral pillar of society and post-secondary institutes are leading the way to educating future generations. 
	   Each year thousands of students attend these institutes and must navigate the challenges of the program as well as the challenges associated with being a new student. 
	   One factor that can have a big impact on a student first experiences with a post-secondary institute is their ability to navigate their campus. 
           There is a constant need for wayfinding on post-secondary campuses, whether a student is looking for their class, a professor's office, or a student service.
	   Fleming College's Student Recruitment office has recognized this need as has decided to enlist the expertise of the S.S. Pathfinders to create a web-based base map 
           and navigational application to enable students an easier time finding their way around campus. This web application is intended to be easily accessible on students' 
	   phones with functionality enabled to help students find paths to their desired location. This service will enable students and visitors to confidently navigate the campus
	   and fully engage with campus services. </p>  
	  <p>As students who have previously completed diploma programs at Fleming College’s Frost Campus, the team at S.S. Pathfinders has a deep connection to the Frost Campus community.
	  We aim to use this connection alongside our passion for GIS to create an application that meets the needs of our client and the college community.  </p>
